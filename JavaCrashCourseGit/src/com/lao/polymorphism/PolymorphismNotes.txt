Polymorphism is one of the pillars of Object Oriented Programming. 

1. What is Polymorphism? 
	Polymorphism is the capability of a method(function) to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. 

2.Types of Polymorphism
	a. Static/Compile/early binding (Method Overloading)
	b. Dynamic/RunTime/late binding (Method Overriding)

3. Overloading vs Overriding

	Overloading:
	1. Method name should be same
	2. If there is any change in the data type or number of arguments or order of arguments, then it is overloading
	3. happens in the compile time
	4. done in same class
	
	Overriding:
	1. Method name should be same
	2. No change in anything
	3. happens in run time
	4. done in parent/child relationship
