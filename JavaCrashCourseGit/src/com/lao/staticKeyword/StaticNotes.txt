Static keyword plays a vital role in Java programming. Understanding of the static keyword will help us a lot while coding.
Static can be used with Class, method, variables and even with a block of code.

Static Method:
---------------
Points to remember about static keyword: 
1)can be used with class, variable, method and block.
2)belong to the class instead of a specific instance.
this means if you make a member static, you can access it without an object.

NOTE: We can call the static method from the non-static method but not otherwise

Static block:
--------------
1)initializing the static variables.
2)gets executed when the class is loaded in memory.
3)can have multiple Static blocks, execution in the written order

Static Variables
-----------------
1)common to all the instances (or objects) of the class because 
it is a class level variable.
2)only a single copy of the static variable is created and 
shared among all the instances of the class.

Static Class:
--------------
A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.
We don't need this. Because we won't use the nested class in most of the real-time programming with respect to test automation.
